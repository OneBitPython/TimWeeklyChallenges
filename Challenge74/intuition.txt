2 3 1 -4 -4 2

1. Take each number as the starting point ie
first starting point will be 0  index then 1 index and so on

2. move forwards and backwards based on the value, 
keep track of whether that value has been crossed or not

3. If a value that has been passed comes again then break

4. If all the values are have been crossed once then output 
True.

in the case of
-9 1 8 9


num_steps_to_move=
curr_value - len(arr)(4)*  (curr_value//len(arr)


if num_steps_to_move is negative then do curr_idx +num_steps_to_move(will be negative)

if num_steps_to_move is positive then 
check if the curr_idx + num_steps_to_move exceeds the len(arr) if it doesnt then do curr_idx+
steps_to_move, if it does exceed then do


number_of_steps_to_move - (len(arr) - idx_of_curr_element)
